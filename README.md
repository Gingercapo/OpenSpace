# OpenSpace
I Have you dreamt about exploring deep space? 

In this project, I will create a simple web game where I can launch a rocket from an uninhabited planet. 

I don't have to be a rocket scientist to complete this project: I will start from the ground by learning how to implement an HTML skeleton of a page and use CSS. Then, 

I will learn how to make the game interactive with JS, and by the end of the project, I will have a firm knowledge foundation for developing my frontend skills.
